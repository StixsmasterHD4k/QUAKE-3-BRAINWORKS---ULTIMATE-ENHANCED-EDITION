### COMPILATION

To compile this code to QVM format:

1. Install q3lcc and q3asm:
   - git clone https://github.com/ec-/q3lcc.git
   - git clone https://github.com/ec-/q3asm.git
   - Build both tools

2. Compile source files:
   ```bash
   cd source
   for file in *.c; do
       q3lcc -DQ3_VM -S -Wf-target=bytecode -Wf-g -o ${file%.c}.asm $file
   done
   ```

3. Assemble QVM:
   ```bash
   echo '-o "vm/qagame"' > game.q3asm
   echo "*.asm" >> game.q3asm
   q3asm -f game.q3asm
   ```

### INSTALLATION

1. Copy qagame.qvm to your Quake 3 mod directory:
   `baseq3/vm/` or `<modname>/vm/`

2. Start Quake 3 and load a map with bots

3. The enhanced AI will automatically activate
